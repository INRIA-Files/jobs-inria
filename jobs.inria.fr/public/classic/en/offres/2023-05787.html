    		<p>Machine learning consists in producing (learning) a computer-based function (usually referred to as a model) from examples (training data). The accuracy and quality of the resulting model are usually directly related to the size of the training data, but training from very large datasets raises at least two problems. First, very large training sets require substantial computing power to train the model in a reasonable time. Second, as machine learning is increasingly applied to sensitive and personal data (e.g. health records, personal messages, user preferences, browsing histories), exposing this data to the learning algorithm raises far-reaching privacy-protection concerns and carries important risks of privacy violation.</p>
<p>These two problems have prompted the emergence of a range of distributed learning techniques, which seek to distribute the learning effort on many machines to scale the learning process and limit privacy leaks by keeping sensitive data on the learning devices. Two related strategies have, in particular, emerged to address these challenges: Federated Learning, initially promoted by Google, and Decentralized Learning, which forgoes entirely any centralized entity in the learning process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, recent works have shown that, in spite of their promises, both of these approaches can be subject to privacy attacks, such as membership inference, data reconstruction, or attribute inference, that make it possible for malicious participants to access private and or sensitive information through the learning process. This PhD aims to improve the privacy protection granted by decentralized learning by exploring how model fragmentation, a technique developed by the WIDE team within the ANR Pamela project (2016-2020), can be combined with private aggregation and random peer sampling, two of the strategies successfully applied to P2P networks.</p>

    		<p>The Ph.D. will investigate</p>
<p>(1) how to organize model fragmentation to obtain privacy protection gains (e.g. which parts of a model are more sensitive than others),</p>
<p>(2) how to combine it with other obfuscation mechanisms (private epidemic aggregation, masking, randomization), and</p>
<p>(3) how to characterize the protection it brings in terms of privacy, and the costs (networks, time, loss of model quality) it causes.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. How to fragment, distribute, and reconstruct decentralized models? Fragmentation has long been identified as a useful principle to hide and protect sensitive information. Applying fragmentation on models during the learning process in a decentralized setting brings however a fresh range of research problems. How should a given model be partitioned? Finer fragments carry less information but may excessively slow down the learning procedure. Some parts of a model might carry more information than others. Can such differences be exploited to deliver varying levels of fragmentation, tailored to the sensitiveness of individual model parts? Once fragmented, model updates must be disseminated to learning nodes and recombined. Al- though these steps appear trivial, the underlying topology used to perform them has far-reaching consequences for the overall security of the system. A static graph, in particular, allows dishonest peers to conduct colluding attacks, while the use of a peer-sampling service (RPS) brings new potential weaknesses, as malicious peers could try to influence the service to serve their goals.</li>
<li>2. How to combine fragmentation and privacy-preserving averaging without disrupting learning? Privacy-preserving averaging can be applied in a straightforward manner by using a privacy-preserving averaging protocol (PPAP) for all gradient exchanges. However, PPAP rounds are typically much slower than those of straightforward averaging. To reduce this cost, we plan to explore how privacy-preserving averaging could be applied only for the most sensitive part of the model, in tandem with heterogeneous fragmentation. One central challenge of this approach lies in designing a hybrid clear-text/obfuscated averaging algorithm that minimally disrupts learning while significantly raising the bar for image-reconstruction attacks. One second path we would like to explore is the notion of pipelining for the obfuscated part. When using a PPA protocol to compute averaged models (or gradients), peers must be delayed until the PPA protocol completes, which can add some substantial overheads to the overall learning procedure. When a PPA protocol executes, however, although the initial values computed by individual nodes are random, the actual aggregated value is progressively revealed as the PPA protocol progresses. The intuition behind pipelining consists in exploiting these noisy yet partially converged values to reduce the delay caused by PPA averaging. Concretely, after an initial static delay, in which the part of the model subject to the PPA protocol remains unchanged, we plan to progressively apply PPA updates in a continuous fashion.</li>
<li>3. How to characterize the gains of protection obtained from fragmentation and privacy-preserving averaging? Although experiments do suggest that privacy attacks on distributed, and in particular reconstruction attacks, are highly sensitive to a range of experimental parameters, this relationship is today not fully understood, and no framework exists to assess privacy protection mechanisms in a systematic and sound way. Although this problem is particularly thorny, and in all likelihood cannot be fully exhausted within a Ph.D., we will strive to develop a comprehensive privacy benchmark to assess the level of protection granted by the mechanisms developed in this thesis. We will in particular aim for representativeness, reproducibility, and as much as possible generalization.</li>
</ul>
<p>We envision the following high-level work plan.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<ul>
<li>
<p>M0-M3: The PhD student will perform a thorough state-of-the-art of the existing attacks and countermeasures in the context of federated and decentralized learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M4-M12: The student will then leverage the state-of-the-art to design and implement a benchmark suite that incorporates the major attack techniques and will apply it to existing decentralized learning solutions. This will allow them to identify the strength and pitfalls of existing solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M13-M24: They will then leverage the developed benchmark to test the privacy guarantees offered by the current model-fragmentation approach developed by the WIDE team. In particular, they will evaluate several fragmentation strategies in combination with different topology-management approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M25-M30: The student will then focus on how to combine fragmentation with privacy-preserving averaging. The goal here consists in designing a hybrid protocol that can combine privacy- preserving steps with clear-text steps on fragmented models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M31-M36: The final months will be devoted to writing the manuscript and on finalizing the pub- lications of the thesis results.</p>
