    		<h3><strong>Context</strong></h3>
<p>Distributed systems and the distributed algorithms that these systems implement are notoriously difficult to design and to verify. This is due to the high number of potential executions that interleave steps of system components (distributed nodes, threads, messaging subsystem) executing independently, leading to bugs that are difficult to reproduce. Formal verification techniques such as model checking or theorem proving help ensure correctness properties of algorithms and of programs. They can be applied at different levels of abstraction. In particular, verifying formal specifications of distributed algorithms at high levels of abstraction allows designers to identify errors that would be very costly to correct during later development stages.</p>
<p>However, languages used for formal modeling and verification are often substantially different from languages used in software development. For example, TLA+ specifications [5] are formulas in a logical language that mixes mathematical set theory and temporal logic, which can be intimidating for system developers. Moreover, verifying an abstract representation of an algorithm does not ensure that its implementation will be correct if the translation from a verified specification to a concrete implementation is manual and thus, error-prone and potentially introducing subtle bugs. It is therefore important to ensure that the implementation of an algorithm corresponds to its high-level representation. This can be achieved to different degrees of confidence (i) by generating test cases from the high-level specification, (ii) by validating traces collected from runs of an implementation against the specification or (iii) by generating an executable implementation from the specification. In this thesis project, we suggest to focus on the latter approach: formal development methods usually allow a high-level specification to be provably refined into a specification that contains enough detail for it to correspond to an implementation. We are thus interested in automatic and formally verifiable translations from this class of specifications to executable distributed programs.</p>
<p>Whereas the translation of sequential programs, including formal compiler verification, is nowadays a well-understood problem, similar techniques for concurrent and distributed programs have been studied to a much lesser extent. Preliminary work exists for Erlang [9] and DistAlgo [7], a domain-specific language extension of Python, but a full bridge between a high-level algorithmic language and executable code has not yet been achieved, let alone full formal verification of such translations. Moreover, the systematic transformation from Event-B formal models [1] into DistAlgo distributed programs proposed in [3] emphasized the fact that the complexity of the translation and thus, of its verification, strongly depends on the distance between the original and the target languages.</p>
<p>A first step towards bridging the gap between the formal specification and the corresponding implementation is the use of modeling languages that are closer to programming languages. In the context of TLA+, PlusCal [6] is an algorithmic language intended for the description of concurrent and distributed algorithms and systems. PlusCal combines the &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; of imperative pseudo-code with the full power of mathematical set theory, used for modeling the data structures manipulated by the algorithm. It is therefore well suited to modeling systems at an intermediate level between abstract TLA+ specifications and executable code. PlusCal algorithms are translated to TLA+ specifications and can be verified using the TLA+ model checkers or the proof assistant TLAPS, thus allowing a system designer to obtain high confidence in the correctness of the algorithm.</p>
<p>PlusCal imposes nevertheless a number of restrictions. In particular, it only offers top-level<br /> parallel processes, making it difficult to model distributed systems where each node consists of several threads executing in parallel. It also lacks primitives that support inter-process communication through message passing: such operations have to be described by defining suitable TLA+ operators. Finally, the full expressiveness of mathematical set theory makes it impossible to automatically generate executable code from PlusCal algorithms. The objective of this thesis is first to define a specification language whose expressiveness is general enough to specify and verify distributed algorithms but also specific enough to enable executable code to be generated from the formal specification of the algorithms. Second, a translation should be implemented for generating executable programs from this language, with high confidence in the fact that the process preserves the semantics.</p>

    		<h3><strong>Project description</strong></h3>
<p>The PlusCal language provides a good starting point for attaining our objective. The extension Distributed PlusCal introduced in [2] addresses the lack of primitives for fine-grained process specifications, and it could be adapted to support not only processes with several distinct threads but also a parameterized number of identical sub-processes, for example for modeling a variable number of processing cores. Since message-passing primitives are not predefined in PlusCal, appropriate operators should be introduced in a standard library in order to define an algorithmic language that is as close as possible to classical distributed programming languages. Again, we can start from Distributed PlusCal but add more flexibility to the implementation of inter-process communication: instead of using predefined FIFO and unordered channels as in the current version of the translator, it would be desirable to define communication semantics through standard TLA+ modules, where their properties can also be proved, and embed those in Distributed PlusCal. The definitions of these communication primitives should be inspired by those found in existing languages and APIs for distributed programming such as Erlang and MPI [8]. These extensions should be designed such that they maintain the close correspondence between the generated TLA+ specification and the PlusCal algorithm.</p>
<p>The unrestricted expressiveness of PlusCal&rsquo;s expression language is still too powerful for code generation. We will therefore initially consider a fragment of PlusCal restricted to ordinary expressions including Booleans, integers, strings, arrays, tuples, and simple sets, as well as (buffered or unbuffered) communication channels. The adequacy of the restricted language for writing interesting algorithms will be validated by using it for expressing standard concurrent and distributed algorithms.</p>
<p>Once the first version of Distributed PlusCal restricted to ordinary expressions is fixed, the Distributed PlusCal translator will be adapted for generating executable distributed programs rather than TLA+ specifications. The target programming languages considered at this stage are DistAlgo [7], MPI [8] and Go [4]. The two first ones are particularly interesting for their clear formally defined semantics, while the latter has growing popularity in industry.</p>
<p>An important aspect of the translation is the high confidence we wish to achieve for preserving the semantics of the specification. Whereas the semantics of TLA+ has a clear mathematical definition, that of PlusCal is currently provided by the implementation of the translation to TLA+. In order to reason about the correctness of the code generator, a (small-step) operational semantics of the language introduced so far must be defined as a first step. An analogous semantics must be given for the target language: DistAlgo comes with a clear semantics but is still evolving, given that it is a research project, formal semantics of MPI exist, but it will be beneficial to limit the fragment that will be used here, and Go is stable, but its semantics is only described semi-formally. Finally, the translation algorithm must be proved correct in order to ensure that every execution of the implementation complies with the semantics of the source program. This effort of semantics definitions and proofs will initially be carried out on paper, but should ultimately be formalized with the help of an interactive proof assistant.</p>
<p>In addition to the work on the correctness of the translator, the approach will also be evaluated experimentally by applying it to standard concurrent and distributed algorithms. Inspiration for suitable case studies can be obtained from the collection of TLA+ examples, as well as from similar collections for the considered implementation languages.</p>
<p>Depending on the outcome of this evaluation, extensions of the language and the translation can be considered, such as support for richer data types, control structures or message-passing primitives, optimizations of the translation for better efficiency, or support for the formal verification of the target code.</p>
